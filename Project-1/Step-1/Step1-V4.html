  Seven months ago,I sat down at the <ol><li><mark>small</mark></li></ol> table in the kitchen of my <ol><li><mark>1960s</mark></li></ol> apartment, <br />
  nestled on the top floor of a building in a <ol><li><mark>vibrant</mark></li></ol> <ol><li><mark>central</mark></li></ol> neighbourhood of Tehran, <br />
  and I did something I had done thousands of times previously. I opened my laptop and <br />
  broke my heart.<br />
  <br />
  A few weeks earlier, I’d been <ol><li><mark>abruptly</mark></li></ol> pardoned and freed from Evin prison in northern<br />
  Tehran. I had been expecting to spend most of my life in those cells: In November 2008,<br />
  I’d been sentenced to nearly 20 years in jail, mostly for things I’d written on my blog.<br />
  <br />
  But the moment, when it came, was unexpected. I smoked a cigarette in the kitchen with<br />
  one of my fellow inmates, and came back to the room I shared with a dozen other men. We<br />
  were sharing a cup of tea when the voice of the floor announcer — another prisoner — <br />
  filled all the rooms and corridors. In his <ol><li><mark>flat</mark></li></ol> voice, he announced in Persian: “Dear<br />
  fellow inmates, the bird of luck has once again sat on one fellow inmate’s shoulders.<br />
  Mr. Hossein Derakhshan, as of this moment, you are <ol><li><h1>free.</h1></li></ol><br />
  That evening was the first time that I went out of those doors as a <ol><li><mark>free</mark></li></ol> man. Everything<br />
  felt new: The <ol><li><mark>chill</mark></li></ol> autumn breeze, the traffic noise from a <ol><li><mark>nearby</mark></ol></li> bridge, the smell,<br />
  the colors of the city I had lived in for most of my life.<br />
