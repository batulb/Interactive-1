&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven months ago, I sat down at the small table in the kitchen of my 1960s apartment, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nestled on the top floor of a building in a vibrant central neighbourhood of Tehran, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I did something I had done thousands of times previously. I opened my laptop and <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broke my heart.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks earlier, I’d been abruptly pardoned and freed from Evin prison in northern<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tehran. I had been expecting to spend most of my life in those cells: In November 2008,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’d been sentenced to nearly 20 years in jail, mostly for things I’d written on my blog.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the moment, when it came, was unexpected. I smoked a cigarette in the kitchen with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of my fellow inmates, and came back to the room I shared with a dozen other men. We<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were sharing a cup of tea when the voice of the floor announcer — another prisoner — <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filled all the rooms and corridors. In his flat voice, he announced in Persian: “Dear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fellow inmates, the bird of luck has once again sat on one fellow inmate’s shoulders.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Hossein Derakhshan, as of this moment, you are free.”<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That evening was the first time that I went out of those doors as a free man. Everything<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;felt new: The chill autumn breeze, the traffic noise from a nearby bridge, the smell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the colors of the city I had lived in for most of my life.<br />
<br />
